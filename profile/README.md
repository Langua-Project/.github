# Langua Project
## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Initial Plan
A language and culture learning app which is focused around making the process of learning fun, efficient (only learn what is needed, within an affordable time), and accessible to wide section of users. Whether that is for:

- An individual travelling or shifting to a new country or region. 
- A student enrolled in a course which demands the need of learning a new lang. 
- Making a cultural shift.
- Just starting a new hobby.
